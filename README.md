## Tasks

- [X] Design STM for puribor

- [X] Add preprocessor function in preprocess.py to make puriborstate to be fitted on stm

- [X] Add hashing_state function in preprocess.py to index much faster

- [ ] Set hydra configuration for all files

- [X] MCTS

- [X] parallelized simulate function

- [ ] pretrained policy function for making faster iteration on simulate function

- [X] parallelized data caching function for faster file upload

- [ ] Experiments stuff
